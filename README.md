## Usage

First of all, you need to get a [Dune Analytics API Key](https://dune.com/docs/api/), the free version must work for most of the use cases.

Once you have your API Key, insert it in the Keys sheet, replacing the dummy text.

Now you can Refresh All the data, and you'll get updated values.

## Next Steps

- Once I have my first node up and running, I'll replace both the validator code and the validator's current balance, for now, you'll see those values being hardcoded for testing purposes. (DONE)

- Battle testing the file.

- Include [additional rewards and penalties](https://docs.gnosischain.com/node/rewards-penalties).
